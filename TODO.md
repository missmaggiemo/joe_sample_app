# TODO

* change seat page-- seat nav links to change seat page, or at least profile page.


* static login form, profile page, etc... links should all link to these static pages

* admin site-- show a sample task list and coffee list

* menu, about, home all live on the same page-- js templates for each 'page', new fragment for each 'page' for correct URLs
