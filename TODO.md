# TODO

* change seat page-- seat nav links to change seat page, or at least profile page.

* payment functionality? open a tab at the "bar"?

* register w/out seat-- but aren't logged in when you register (must log in with seat)

* side swipe to go to next page? or all one page scrolling for instructions?






* static login form, profile page, etc... links should all link to these static pages

* admin site-- show a sample task list and coffee list

* menu, about, home all live on the same page-- js templates for each 'page', new fragment for each 'page' for correct URLs
